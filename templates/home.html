<h1>Codenames for Zoom</h1>

    <p class="flow-text">This app is designed to support playing Codenames over Zoom. The basic idea is to use Zoom screen sharing to share a the board. There are two ways to play. The first way, called <strong>blended mode</strong>, involves using a document camera (or other video device) to capture a real game board from one player, who manages the placement of cards. This app then provides a unique keycard that can be shared among the spymasters, since sharing the actual keycards is hard to do. The second way, called <strong>online mode</strong>, involves using a board created by this app as well as a keycard that can be shared by spymasters. In online mode, the gameboard is also shared using screen sharing. The process of sharing keycards is explained on the keycards pages.</p>

<div class="row">

        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-content">
                <span class="card-title">Blended Mode</span>
                <p class="">Choose this option if you just want to create a keycard.
                        For example, you may be sharing a real gameboard by Zoom,
                        and you want to share a keycard in a secure way.</p>

            <div class="card-action">
                <a class="" href="keycard" target="_blank">

                        This will create a gameboard that can be shared with all players, along with
                a link to generate a keycard for that game.</p>
